## My name is James
### I am currently a part-time YouTuber based in the US of A.
I am 20 years of age, working full time, and have a hobby of playing video games and sharing them on the internet.<br/>
I am also currently learning CSS and JS wih the help of [@JustinPooters](github.com/justinpooters)

### Who am I, what do I do, and what does The Great Beyond mean?
As I mentioned, I am a gaming YouTuber. My channel is called [The Great Beyond](youtube.com/thegreatbeyond).<br/><br/>
**The Great Beyond** means to think about your future. Think about who you want to be and what you need to do to get there.<br/>
*Find your future* is my slogan. If people tell you you are "this" person, or "that" person, or you do "this" wrong, you don't need to worry about them.<br/><br/>
Follow the goals you have set for yourself. If you don't have a goal set, then try to find it, by finding what you most enjoy, whether it be art, developing, gaming, whatever the case may be.

### What I am currently working on:
YouTube is huge for me, but that is not all.<br/>
I am also working on a multi-purpose discord bot called [Hyperbot](link pending). The intent, and hope, is to remove the need to have dozens of bots on one server, when you could have one to do it all! Join the [support server](discord.gg/MnWyKzC) if you are interested in knowing a bit more about the bot.<br/>
I have some [themes](link pending) and [plugins](link pending) I am working on with [@JustinPooters](github.com/justinpooters) that are designated for [Powercord](powercord.dev)

### How you can reach me:
Comment on any video on my [YouTube Channel](youtube.com/thegreatbeyond).<br/>
Join me on [stream](twitch.tv/live_tgb) if I am live.<br/>
[Tweet](twitter.com/memoriesliveon) at me.<br/>
Join my [Discord](thegreatbeyond.site/discord) server. I am the most active on there.

### If you have any questions about me, please feel free to ask me at any of the resources above!

## I hope you *Find Your Future*!
